# Landing-Page


This is practice for using HTML and CSS to design a website's landing page, along with a sign up/registration form accessible by one of the header links.

<h2>Concepts learned from this project:</h2>

-Div and flex container, flexbox placement, and page layout.   </br>
-Static header navbar with links containing CSS hover transition effects to change color. </br>
-CSS Added for mobile phone viewing support of the website with @media only sections.  </br>
-CSS for adding animations (added h2 to float in from margin). </br>
-Adding forms with associated inputs and labels of the submit action, to post to "http://httpbin.or/post"; how to receive user input. </br>
-Other CSS such as button inputs that trigger a box shadow and border color change on focus; making inputs reqiuired for the form, etc.

If button CSS (mouseover, click effects) do not work, go to Dev Tools (F12 in Chrome) -> Network -> Disable Cache, then delete your browser's cache manually.  Then reopen the live preview page off of GitHub Pages.
